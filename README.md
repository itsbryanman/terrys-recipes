Um, let’s just sprinkle a little more sugar on top, you know?

# Terry's Recipes (A Sweeter Touch)

Hey there, friend. Welcome to this special spot on the internet, lovingly devoted to keeping alive the beloved recipes of **Terry Carmen**, a home cook with a heart big enough to feed the whole neighborhood—twice.  

## About This Project

Terry, who shared all this goodness on his site, [Bupkis.org](https://bupkis.org), never wanted these recipes to fade away. To me, it’s clear he just wanted that comfort of a home-cooked meal to outlast his own journey, like a pot of soup that never quite runs dry. He said:
> _"At the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, and these were almost all in the kitchen."_

And, well, that pretty much says it all, doesn’t it? Life’s big secret, right there in your mixing bowl.

## What's Inside

You’ll find a colorful pantry of delights:
- Starters that’ll get your tummy rumbling.
- Mains that’ll fill your house with savory smells you’ll want to hug.
- Desserts sweet enough to make even your toughest day feel like a warm hug.

Each recipe’s saved in Markdown—simple and neat—just how you’d want to pass on a family secret. Some of ‘em come with notes, stories, and little tweaks that reflect Terry’s personal flair. You can kinda imagine him standing beside you in the kitchen, grinning as you give his recipes a whirl.

## How to Use

1. Take a peek at what’s here, pick something that makes you go, “Oh man, that sounds delicious.”
2. Open up that specific Markdown file and soak in the instructions.
3. Feel free to grab the whole collection with a simple Git command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsbryanman/terrys-recipes.git
   ```
   Terry’s wish was for these recipes to keep making bellies happy long after he’s moved on. There’s even an offline archive at [Bupkis.org](https://bupkis.org) for days when the internet’s feeling a bit moody. No ads, no spam, just heartfelt cooking memories.

To be honest, Terry’s reflections remind me that none of us knows exactly how much time we’ve got cooking on our own stovetop. One day you’ve got years stretching out like a never-ending pasta strand, and the next day you’re savoring every bite as if it’s dessert. Terry got to see what was coming, and sure, that’s tough, but he also saw it as a gift—time to cherish moments and stir a pot or two more with the people he loves.

So, do him (and yourself) a favor: gather your friends and family, cook up something from these pages, and create some real, honest-to-goodness happy memories. Money, power, status—pfft! They don’t taste half as good as a homemade meal shared with folks who matter.

Right now, Terry’s still here in spirit, cooking slowly and savoring every moment, even though his left side’s being a bit stubborn after surgery. He jokes about it, and honestly, that’s just who he is—someone who’ll make banana bread for you when nothing else tastes right.

After all, that’s what these recipes are about: feeding the heart as much as the stomach. Happy cooking, and give a nod to Terry as you stir, taste, and smile.
