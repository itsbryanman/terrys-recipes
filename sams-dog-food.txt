Title: Sammi’s Dog Food

This is the dog-food that we worked out with Sammi’s vet. I make no claims that it would be good for any other dog in the world, but if you’re interested, here it is! 😎

Sammi is a 13 year old Yellow Lab mix that weadopted from the CNYSPCA. She’s been a lot of fun and an awesome friend for more than a decade, and weighed about 70 pounds when healthy. She was down to about 55 when she was sick with Lyme Disease, could hardly walk and wouldn’t eat any food – canned or dry.

With antibiotics, a thyroid supplement and this recipe, she came back from almost dead, and is her old self again.

I’ve had dogs my whole life, but never thought much about food quality until Sammi stopped eating, entirely. We tried all sorts of different dogfoods, but she simply refused to eat. Finally I asked an employee atPet Supplies Plusif they had anything that was “good enough formeto eat.”

She said something I’ll never forget: “Regardless of what it says on the label, if it was really “human quality food”, it would be at Price Chopper or Wegmans, not here.” That really hit home. It’s absolutely true. No sane business would sell something for $1 a pound when they could get $3 for it.

That’s when I decided that Sam was worth an extra money and effort and deservedrealfood.

PS. If you need a great vet, give Jesse Shayvitz atQuarryside Animal Hospitala call. She’s really nice, extremely sharp, loves animals and picked right up on Sammi’s Lyme Disease and Thyroid when our previous vet missed it.

PPS. If Pet Supplies Plus management is reading this, please don’t reprimand your employees for the above advice. It was very welcome. Sammi wasn’t eating, and the advice saved her life. Most places have employees that know nearly nothing and even if they do know, don’t care. I shop at Pet Supplies Plus because the employees actually know what they’re talking about and care about the animals.
