Title: Guinness and Chili-Garlic Mustard

This mustard is easy to make and has ton of awesome flavor without being too spicy.

It grew out of my desire to have a spicy mustard that could stand up to a great cheddar cheese, hot-dog or salami, without overwhelming it, and without costing $5 for a tiny jar.

Besides, if you ever find yourself on Chopped, now you can have mustard even if there isnâ€™t any in the pantry!

Now, on to the recipe!

Where to buy the ingredients:

Spices can be insanely expensive if you buy them in the wrong place.

This recipe, for example, requires dried allspice berries. Theyâ€™re almost impossible to find in any of the major grocery stores near me, and were extremely expensive in the places that did carry them. However just by chance, I tried Price-Rite and they had a half ounce package for less than $2, which is enough to keep me in mustard for at least a year. They seem to be less expensive and easier to find in grocery stores with a lot of Caribbean customers.

Mustard seeds are another one. Theyâ€™re $8 for a little jar in Price Chopper, but $2 for a 14 ounce bag in the Asian and Indian markets.

I was unable to find similar savings on the Guinness, however. ðŸ˜Ž
