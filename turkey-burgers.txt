Title: Turkey Burgers with Mushrooms

These are amazing. I think these actually taste better than beef.

This makes 6 nice thick burgers with a beautiful crust.

Makes 6 burgers, 4 WeightWatcherâ€™s FreeStyle points each.

These hold beautifully in the refrigerator, and can be made Sunday night, and can be reheated for dinner during the week.
