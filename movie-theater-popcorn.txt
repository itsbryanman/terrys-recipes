Title: Movie Theater Popcorn Recipe

Most people have tried popping corn at home, but there’s almost always something wrong with it. It might be gummy or hard or burned or not crunchy or any of a bunch of other problems that make you willing to pay $8 for 20 cents worth of popcorn at the movies.

Well, I’m here to help! 😎

First we need to talk about tools: You need a pot and a lid. But probably not the pot or lid you’re thinking of.

It needs to have a heavy bottom for even heat distribution and be at least as tall (or taller) than it is wide, since popped corn takes up a lot of space. If the pot is too short, enough corn to cover the bottom will overflow the top.

Next we need a lid, so the corn stays in the pot and not all over your floor. However since moisture is the enemy of crunchy popcorn, you absolutely don’t want that nice tight lid that came with the pot. What works much better is either a strainer or colander that’s large enough to cover the top of your pot.

To that end, my favorite combination is a tall pasta/stock pot and a big strainer to use as a cover.

Last we need to discuss the actual popcorn and oil. There’s absolutely no need to spend $4/Lb for any corn sold by a white-haired guy, or that has the work “gourmet” on the package. Youdowant the freshest popcorn you can find, which means that you want to buy from a place that sellsa lotof popcorn.

So far my favorites have been WalMart “Great Value” popcorn and Wegman’s Store brand.

The oil needs to be Peanut Oil because of it’s high smoking point. Popcorn uses a lot of heat and to borrow a phrase from Alton Brown, burned oil isnot“good eats” .

However that’s enough talk Let’s cook!
