Title: My McMuffin

When McDonalds first started serving breakfast, I was amazed at the Egg McMuffin. It was just exploding with flavor. The English Muffin was hot, lightly browned, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the Canadian Bacon tasted like Canadian Bacon , the Egg tasted like Egg and even the cheese tasted like cheese.

However after a while, as happens with all factory food, it started to lose something. Then it lost pretty much everything. The egg didn’t taste very “eggy” anymore and the English Muffin started showing up just warm and raw and the flavors just weren’t there. My breakfast joy had turned into a flavorless tepid sandwich not worth the time it takes to get through the drive-through.

A few weeks ago, I thought to myself, “Self. you can do better than this limp flavorless waste of time!” and sure enough, I could!

Give this a try, it will bring back the original joy of breakfast, and then some!

Note that successfully creating a perfect Egg McMuffin is about half quality ingredients and about half timing, so be sure to prep all your ingredients before you start cooking

Process:

I know this sounds like an insane amount of detail, but once you’ve had this on a Sunday morning with some fresh coffee and a newspaper, you’ll never be able to do the drive-through again.

Enjoy!
