Title: Butternut Squash Soup

This is an amazingly yummy soup, even for people that don’t like squash.

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Ingredients:
- 1 Large Butternut Squash (about 2 Lbs)
- 5 Cups Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth
- 1/2 C Minced Onion
- 1 C Sour Cream
-  Whole Nutmeg

Directions:
- Peel the squash, cut in half length-wise and scoop out the seeds and fibers with a spoon, then cut into 1 or 2 inch cubes (neatness doesn’t count, since it’s all going though the blender anyway).
- Add the broth, squash, and onion to a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for about 25 minutes, or until squash is soft.
- Process in a blender in batches until smooth.
- Optional: Refrigerate until needed
- Return to pot and reheat until hot, but not boiling
- Add pepper to taste. It probably won’t need any salt, but it will definitely need pepper.
- Add a light grating of nutmeg.
- Add sour cream and mix with whisk until smooth
- Serve immediately
