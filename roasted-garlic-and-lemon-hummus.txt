Title: Roasted Garlic and Lemon Hummus

Have you ever wanted to make smooth creamy hummus like you get in a restaurant? Well, here it is!

The trick is to use a little of the water the beans were packed in, and use a food processor.

Itâ€™s a big hit at parties and the bowl is always empty within a few minutes.

Note that because the chick-peas have a relatively mild flavor, the amount of seasoning you add will have a big impact on the flavor. Be sure to check and add more if necessary.The garlic flavor will intensify slightly in the refrigerator, so if itâ€™s a little mild initially, it will probably be perfect the next day.
