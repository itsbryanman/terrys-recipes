Title: Roasted Vegetables

If youâ€™ve never tried roasted vegetables, you owe it to yourself to try these. Youâ€™ll be amazed! Roasting makes vegetables taste like food instead of something that food eats.

I would never have believed if I hadnâ€™t tried it. ðŸ˜Ž

You can roast almost anything. These are a few of my favorites.
