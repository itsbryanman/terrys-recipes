Title: Seared Tuna w/Garlic Chipotle Pepper Sauce

Considering that this uses a prepared spice mixture as well as a bottled sauce, it’s not actually much of a “recipe” in the traditional sense, however I really like the way it tastes and wanted to document it in case anybody else wants to try it.

Serves 2 hungry people or 3 not-so-hungry people

Each slice can also be served over a small block ofsushi rice, as sushi.

Ingredients:
- 1 Lb. Sashimi Grade Tuna
- 1/4 Cup Emeril Lagasse’s Rustic Rub – Recipe availablehere
-   Dinoaur Barbecue’s Garlic Chipotle Pepper Sauce
