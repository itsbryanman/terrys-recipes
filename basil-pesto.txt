Notes

Ingredients:
- 3 Cups Fresh (live) Basil, including the delicate stems. Remove the hard, woody stems.

- 1 or 2 Ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (a block about 1/2″ x 2″ x 2″)
- 2 Cloves Garlic
-   Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1/2 Teaspoon Kosher SaltStart with 1/4 tsp and add more if needed. Careful! – There’s very little difference between enough salt to make it perfect and enough to make it too salty.
