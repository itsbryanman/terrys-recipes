Title: White Chicken Chili with Beans and Corn

This is absolutely delicious, zero (0) points on Weight Watchers and alsonot“diet food”.

I’d eat this in a restaurant and have no second thoughts that I passed up the burger or wings. It’s that good.

There aren’t a lot of ingredients here and it’s not complicated to make, so you might expect it to be boring. It’s not. The Chili in Adobo gives it a beautiful, complex smoky flavor and the corn added at the end gives it a very nice texture contrast against the smooth beans and broth, and the lime gives it some nice brightness and citrus notes.

Notes:

If you buy the “family pack” of chicken be sure to also increase the amount of the other ingredients, or the soup will taste flat and boring.
