Title: 16 Bean Soup with Bacon

This soup is visually interesting because of all the different sizes and colors of beans. It has varying textures, a light smoky aroma and a really nice flavor,without being overly spicy.

This recipe also works nicely with 16 Bean mix, (or pretty much any kind of dried beans you want to use). If you don’t have smoked Paprika, you can substitute regular Paprika and a 1/4t liquid smoke.
