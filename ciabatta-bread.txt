Title: Ciabatta Bread

My ciabatta bread recipe calls for very little yeast and a long, cool, slow rise.

The flavor and texture is better than anything you’ll find in a store, and quite a few bakeries.

You owe it to yourself to try making your own bread. It’s not difficult and it tastes incredible.

Makes (4) loaves

Notes:Please note that I’m not a food snob for specifying bottled water. The chlorine content and pH of municipal water systems varies wildly depending on the level of contamination of the source, and what kind of maintenance activities are going on in the water system. Bottled water is always consistent, and contains little or no chlorine. The same chlorine that kills the bacteria in the water also kills the yeast. Using chlorinated tap water may result in inconsistent results and great frustration

Ingredients:
- 715 ml Bottled Water
- 1 t (5g) Sugar
- 1 t (5g) Instant Yeast
- 2.2 Lbs (1000g) Bread Flour, unbleached, un-enriched, if possible.I useNew Hope Mills.
- 2 T (39g) Kosher Salt
-   Corn Meal
- 1 C Ice Cubes
