Title: Tahini Sauce

I make no claim to this sauce, except that it’s awesome!

It’s a slightly modified version of the one on the “Ziyad Premium Tahini” bottle.

Note that I get nothing from recommending Chobani.  The sauce really needs the bite their yogurt has, and not all yogurts have it..

Ingredients:
- 1 Cup Tahini
- 1 1/4 Cups Chobani Lowfat PlainGreekYogurt
- 2 Cloves Garlic
- 1/2 Teaspoon Kosher Salt
- 2 Large (or three small) Lemons
- 1/2 Bunch Parsley

Directions:
- Juice all the lemons, then add water to make one cup of liquid.
- Put everything in the food processor and pulse
- Chill.
