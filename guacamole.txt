Title: Guacamole

There are hundreds of recipes for guacamole, and I’ve tried a lot of them.

This one is my absolute favourite. Once it leaves the kitchen, the bowl always comes back empty.

Note:Don’t keep this for days. It will start to ferment and get an acidic/fizzy flavor. If you’re not going to use it right away, you can vacuum pack it and freeze it with no or little change in flavor or texture.

Makes about 3 cups
