Title: Napa Cabbage Kimchi (Kimchee)

Based onChristine Gallary’srecipe.

Note that gochugaru is not the same as other crushed red pepper you might have. It’s milder and smokier. Other red pepper powder will probably leave you surprised and disappointed.

Ingredients:
- 2 Small (or 1 very large) Napa Cabbage. You need enough to completely fill the glass jar. This is generally about 1.8 kg (4 pounds). After salting and draining, it will have lost some volume, which leaves enough room for the other ingredients.
- 250 Grams Kosher Salt
- 500 Grams  Daikon radish, peeled and cut into 2 “x 1/4″ x 1/4” sticks.
- 2 small Bunches Scallions, ragged green ends and roots trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces. Use both white and green parts
- 160 mL (2/3 C)  Korean red pepper powder (gochugaru). Look for고춧가루on the bag. This makes it about as spicy as hot chicken wings. If you want it milder or hotter, adjust to your taste.Note that gochugaru is not the same as other crushed red pepper you might have. It’s milder and smokier. Other red pepper powder will probably leave you surprised and disappointed.
- 20ml (4 tsp)  Finely minced Korean salted shrimp (saeujeot). Look for새우젓on the jar. It will be in the refrigerated case.
- 120ml (1/2 cup)  Fish Sauce
- 120ml (1/2 cup)  Grated or finely chopped ginger
- 12-14 Cloves Minced garlic
- 15ml (1T)  Granulated sugar

Directions:
- Peel off any dirty or damaged outer leaves, then cut cabbage in half lengthwise, then in 2″ wide slices, discarding the root.
- Put the leaves in a large plastic container with a lid, alternating layers of salt and cabbage. Add water to just cover, then put a few plates on top of the cabbage to keep the leaves underwater and put lid on container.
- Let sit 24 hours at room temperature.
- Dump out salt water, rinse cabbage well with fresh water and dry in a salad spinner. If you leave too much water, the kimchi “sauce” will be weak.
- Wear gloves!The this is spicy and you don’t want to mix this with bare hands then rub your eyes.
- Add everything but the cabbage to a bowl and mix very well with your hands.
- Take this mixture and add it to the cabbage bowl and mix well. make sure each leaf is coated.
- Pack into a gallon jug, cover with air-lock (bubbler) lid and let sit at room temperature for a few days until it tastes like you want it to.
- When you’re happy with it, replace the air-lock lid with solid lid and refrigerate.
