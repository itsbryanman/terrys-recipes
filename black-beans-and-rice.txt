Title: Black Beans and Rice

Everybody goes crazy for this. It has a light smoky taste and tons of flavor, without being overly spicy. The beans and rice form a complete protein, so no meat is actually necessary, although the bacon really does add a nice flavor.

It’s cheap, healthy and yummy, which is a really hard-to-beat combination.

Note: If you don’t have smoked Paprika, you can substitute regular Paprika and a 1/4t liquid smoke.

Ingredients:
- 1.5 Lbs Dried Black Beans
