Title: Matzoh Meal Recipe – How To Make Matzoh Meal! (Oh No! I’m Out of Matzoh Meal!)

I can’t believe I’m writing this, I didn’t figure this out until this year, so here you go . . .

If you don’t have matzoh meal but do have matzoh, you can make it yourself!

Toss the matzoh in a food processor and pulse until it looks like matzoh meal.

That’s it!

PS.

This is also great for the times when stores have cases of matzoh, cheap, but the little can of matzoh meal is $4.
