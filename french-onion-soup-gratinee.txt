Title: French Onion Soup Gratin√©e (Baked French Onion Soup)

This is the best French Onion Soup Gratin√©e I‚Äôve ever had, including some from very expensive restaurants.

The ‚Äútrick‚Äù is that French Onion Soup Gratin√©e issupposedto beonionsoup. Not canned beef broth with some onions, soggy bread and cheap cheese. This recipe extracts nearly every possible flavor variation from the onions, via multiple deglazings and several different levels of cooking.

The first batch of onion gets caramelized until there‚Äôs almost nothing left but wonderful fond. The second batch of onions gets cooked until mostly caramelized and very soft, the third even less and the fourth is left with a distinct ‚Äúonion‚Äù flavor.

It has a beautifully deep, rich flavor with layers of onion taste profiles ranging from deep, dark and sweet, to bright and slightly sharp with a little bite. The sherry provides a touch of brightness and the thyme and bay leaf provide a nice ‚Äúgreen‚Äù note.

The soup‚Äôs deep, rich flavor comes fromcaramelizationof the onions. Traditionally, this is done just once when saut√©ing the onions, however there‚Äôs no reason to stop there. The onions are still packed with potential flavor, and we‚Äôre going to get all of it!

This recipe calls for sauteing a batch of onions until they‚Äôre nearly gone, then deglazing the pan with a little water. Then we do it again. And again, creating a deep, rich onion broth with huge flavor. The last batch of onions doesn‚Äôt get cooked quite as much, which creates an additional layer of flavor (a little sharp with a distinct onion flavor), which contrasts nicely with the rich, slightly sweet flavor in the broth.

The garlic toast adds a nice garlicky bite, the aroma of the olive oil and a wonderful crunchy texture, the herbs and sherry brighten it up, and selecting the right cheese makes everything just about perfect.

This will make your guests insanely jealous, since it‚Äôs very unlikely they have ever had French Onion Soup this good anywhere, ever.

It‚Äôs also great for impressing a date. If you serve this with a small salad of fresh baby greens, crumbled blue cheese,¬† balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, a perfectly cooked filet mignon andcouscous with pine nuts, you had better be ready to get married. üòé
