Title: Mexican Yellow Rice w/Corn

It’s great in a burrito, or as a side dish with some re-fried beans. It’s not just “rice that’s yellow” it’s authentic Mexican Yellow Rice with Corn and is absolutely packed with tons of flavor.

The pan always comes back empty and I’ve never had leftovers when serving this.
