Title: Gambas Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)

Gambas Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp) has a huge, bold, well-balanced flavor, combining fragrant, spicy olive oil, delicate shrimp, warm garlic and hot, smoky chiles. And you’ll never forgive yourself if you don’t try it!

It looks impressive when served, makes a great appetizer, and the cooking oil is phenomenal for dipping.

Shopping Tip:Unless you can see shrimp boats from your bedroom window, buy the shrimp individually quick-frozen. Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed. There’s no reason to thaw them before you’re ready to cook, since the “spoilage clock” start ticking as soon as they get much above 0°F.

Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you’re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.

The night before, if frozen:

Cooking:

Serves about 3 for dinner, or 6 as an appetizer.

Variation:

Before sautéing the shrimp, toss a 1/2 box of thin spaghetti (capellini) into boiling, salted water. When the pasta is about half cooked, start the shrimp, then when the pasta is done, drain well, dump into the pan of shrimp, gently toss and serve immediately.

Ingredients:
- 1.5 Lb Raw, shell-on, 21-25 Shrimp. “21-25” refers to the size of the shrimp, not the type. It means that there are “between 21 and 25 shrimp in a pound.”Buy raw, shell-on shrimp and peel them yourself. They tastemuchbetter.
- 1/2 C (approx) Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1  Chipotle Chile, finely chopped including seeds, without stem (I actually use about 3/4 of it)
- 2 Large Cloves Garlic, sliced very thin
- 1 Pinch Kosher Salt (optional/to taste)
- 1 Tablespoon Parsley, chopped fine
-   Good, crusty bread
