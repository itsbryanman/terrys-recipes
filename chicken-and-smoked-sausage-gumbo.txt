Title: Chicken and Smoked Sausage Gumbo

This is my favorite gumbo recipe! The flavors are complex with a good bit of heat, but not over the top.

The trick to the incredible depth of flavor is in cooking the roux. You can’t rush it, and need to bring it all the way to a milk chocolate color. We’re going to cook the veggies in it, so it will continue getting darker, with more complex flavors. Be careful to not burn it. Roux cooks much more quickly towards the end. It might take 15 minutes to go from “raw” to “coffee with cream,” another minute to go to “dark chocolate” and seconds to go to “burnt”.

Note that a lot of the flavor and heat comes from the Andoulli Sausage, and the sausage varies greatly by brand, so you may want to cook up a small piece first, taste it, and adjust the other seasonings accordingly.

This gets even better if stored overnight in the refrigerator, and will keep for hours in a crock-pot on “low” or “warm.”

This recipe originally appeared in “Louisiana Real and Rustic” by Emeril Lagasse with Marcelle Bienvenu, 1996, William Morrow & Co., New York, NY, and is used here with permission. I’ve made changes, but this is still mostly Chef Lagasse’s recipe, and it’s definitely his spice blend.

Many thanks to Emeril & Company for allowing me to post it.
