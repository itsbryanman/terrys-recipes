Title: Spicy Barbecue Sauce

This one is all mine. I pulled some oven-fried chicken out of the freezer, and it was a little boring, so I said to myself “Self, check the refrigerator and see if we have some barbecue sauce!”

Happily, there was none. However there was ketchup, chili-garlic sauce and maple syrup.

Based on nothing but availability and my like of chili, garlic and maple, I mixed it up and it was possibly the best barbecue sauce I’ve ever had, anywhere!

Enjoy!
