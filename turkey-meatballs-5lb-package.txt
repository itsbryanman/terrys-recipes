Title: Turkey Meatballs – 5Lb Package

Make a few extra since some always seem to “disappear” before they leave the kitchen. They’re the absolute equal and possibly better than any beef-based meatball I’ve tried.

Note that this is the same as theother recipeon the site, but is scaled up for a Sam’s Club 5Lb package of Ground Turkey.

Cooking Method #1

Cooking Method #2

Note that this recipe work well when scaled, and the balls and sauce freeze beautifully.

At least in this area, ground turkey at Sam’s Club in 5 pound packages costs about 1/3 as much as at the grocery store.

Makes about 40 meatballs, slightly larger than a golf-ball.

Ingredients:
- 5 Pound Ground Turkey
- 7 1/2 Slices Plain white bread (nothing with a strong taste, since it’s for texture, not flavor)
- 1 2/3 C Onion, finely chopped
- 5  Large Egg
- 1 2/3 T Soy Sauce
- 1 2/3 T Worcestershire Sauce
- 2 1/2 t Garlic Powder
- 1 1/4 t Dry Mustard
- 4 Jars Your favorite spaghetti sauce
