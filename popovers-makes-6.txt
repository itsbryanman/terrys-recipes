Title: Popovers

These popovers are so incredibly light, crispy and awesome that you’ll want to blow off the rest of the day just to linger over breakfast, fresh coffee and a newspaper.

They go beautifully with an omelet. and make a nice home for a perfectly poached egg with a slice of cheddar.

A few notes:

This is a very simple recipe, but it’s important to make sure everything is the right temperature, or they won’t puff up.

Popovers puff up from internal steam pressure. If the ingredients are cold, the outside will harden before the inside puffs up.

Enjoy! Each one is a unique work of art.
