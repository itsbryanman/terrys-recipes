Title: Pizza Sauce

Note that there’s no salt listed in the ingredients. This is because the canned tomatoes already contain enough salt.

Ingredients:
- 3 28 oz Cans Whole Plum Tomatoes, drained. I like Cento “San Marzano”
- 1 Medium Yellow Onion, minced
- 3 Cloves Garlic, finely minced
- 12 Leaves Fresh Basil
