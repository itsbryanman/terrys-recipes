Title: Black Bean & Tortilla Soup

This is a warm, filling, absolutely amazing soup with a light smoky aroma and tons of flavor, without being overly spicy. The soup will taste a little too peppery when tasted alone, but when garnished with the sour cream and cheese, is perfect.

If you don’t have smoked Paprika, you can substitute regular Paprika and a 1/4t liquid smoke.

Note:This will thicken as it cools, as well as overnight in the refrigerator. Don’t be afraid to thin it out with some water if it gets too thick.

If you make it alittlethicker put it in a large flat dish, cover with shredded cheese, sour cream, and scallions, it makes an awesome dip for tortilla chips.
