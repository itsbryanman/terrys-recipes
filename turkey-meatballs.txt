Title: Turkey Meatballs

Make a few extra since some always seem to “disappear” before they leave the kitchen. They’re the absolute equal and possibly better than any beef-based meatball I’ve tried.

If you want to make a big batch, a scaled-up version ishere.

Note that this recipe work well when scaled, and the balls and sauce freeze beautifully.

At least in this area, ground turkey at Sam’s Club in 5 pound packages costs about 1/3 as much as at the grocery store.

Makes  6 – 8 meatballs.

Ingredients:
- 1 Pound Ground Turkey
- 1 1/2 Slices Plain white bread (nothing with a strong taste, since it’s for texture, not flavor)
- 1/3 C Chopped Onion
- 1  Large Egg
- 1 t Soy Sauce
- 1 t Worcestershire Sauce
- 1/2 t Garlic Powder
- 1/4 t Dry Mustard
- 1 Jar Your favorite spaghetti sauce
