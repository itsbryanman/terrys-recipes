Title: Hamentashen

This one is from my grandmother’s old cookbook (Jewish Cookery, Leah Leonard, 1949) It’s a little on the imprecise side, but given that the cookbook is sixty years old, that’s not surprising. I’ve added notes where I could, and will continue to update it when possible.

Please let me know how it worked and if you made any changes.

Update:

The hamentashen was tested by a nice reddit user who filled them withpeach preserves, and a raspberry jam said they came out beautifully, and if you use Jam, use a little less since it tended to boil over.
