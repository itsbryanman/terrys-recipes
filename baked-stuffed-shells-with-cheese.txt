Title: Baked Stuffed Shells with Cheese

This is a very satisfying, easy to make recipe that freezes beautifully and is great for making ahead, then reheating and serving with some fresh bread and a nice red wine, after a long day at work.

This is based on the Baked Stuffed Shells recipe from the P&R Jumbo Stuffed Shells box (or Ronzoni), except that I tripled the recipe and added more parsley, mozzarella and sauce.

It looks like you’re making a lot of food, and you are, however the prep work is nearly identical, regardless of how many you’re making, so I like to make a lot then freeze it, then reheat whenever I want some.

Ingredients:
- 2 12 Oz Packages Jumbo Shells
- 8 Cups Whole Milk or Part Skim Ricotta
