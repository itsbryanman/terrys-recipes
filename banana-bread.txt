Title: Banana Bread

This was originally from The American Heart Association Cookbook. I’ve made a few changes, but most of the credit goes to them.

It’s the best Banana Bread I’ve ever had, and as a bonus, it’s reasonably low in fat, and the fat it does have is from vegetable oil. It’s so good, if you don’t tell anybody they’ll never know.
