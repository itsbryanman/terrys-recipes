Title: Challah

Equipment Needed:

I use 2 Pizza Stones for this recipe because both loaves won’t fit on one stone. You can also use one stone and bake one loaf while other loaf rises a little more.

Ingredients:
- 5 Grams Active dry yeast
- 250 Grams Bottled water (Evian, Poland Springs, etc.)
- 75 Grams Sugar
- 1 Stick (4 ounces or 113 grams) Unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 Cup (250g) Whole milk or 3/4 cup 2% milk + 1/4 cup half-and-half.
- 1 Tablespoon Mild honey
- 22 Grams Kosher Salt
- 4 Large Eggs
- 1 kg High-gluten flour, bread flour
- Optional  Sesame or poppy seeds
-   Corn Meal

Directions:
- Place the water in a medium bowl and warm to 80°F add 1 teaspoon of the sugar and whisk it. While still whisking, add the yeast.
- Let sit for 10 minutes. It should be foamy. If not, the yeast was old or dead, or the water was too hot. In either case, you’ll need to start over with fresh water, sugar and yeast.
- Place butter in a large glass bowl and microwave until just melted (not hot).
- Add milk, sugar, salt and honey. Whisk until dissolved. Warm in microwave for a few seconds if necessary to keep mixture warm enough so butter stays liquid.
- Whisk in the yeast/water mixture and the eggs.
- Pour into the dough mixer and set on low and add the flour.
- Once it combines increase speed to medium and continue kneading until the dough can bewindowpaned(usually about 10 minutes)
- Dump the dough into a 6+ quart plastic tub with a lid and leave it at room temperature ovenight.
- Stretch dough out into an elongated blob and fold in half. Rotate 90° and repeat until you have done this 4 times.
- Let it rise until dough has doubled again and repeat the above step
