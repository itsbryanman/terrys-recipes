Title: Sam’s Club Leftover Chicken Soup With Matzoh Balls

Sam’s Club makes some really tasty roasted chicken. And with a little extra work, it’s the “meal that keeps on giving.”

You can get a couple of nice dinners out of it, then a couple of good sandwiches, then just when you’re ready to toss it, you read this and discover it makes awesome soup!

Imighteven like this better than chicken soup from raw chicken:

Cooking note: This isn’t a “fussy” or time consuming dish. There is no precision cutting involved. If you can peel the garlic and hack up all the veggies into reasonable size chunks, everything will be awesome!
