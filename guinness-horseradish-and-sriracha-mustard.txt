Title: Guinness, Horseradish and Sriracha Mustard

Donâ€™t Panic!

While itâ€™s spicy, it isnâ€™t nearly as spicy as it sounds, and has a ton of awesome flavor! The Sriracha is hot and garlicky, and the horseradish adds a little kick and some acid to balance things out.

This mustard grew out of my desire to have a spicy mustard that could stand up to a great cheddar cheese, hot-dog or salami, without overwhelming it, and without costing $5 for a tiny jar.

I had done quite a bit of research on making mustard and found all sorts of references to simmering, soaking, and otherwise fussing with the mustard seeds. I donâ€™t have that much patience. So I kept on looking.

It turns out that a spice grinder (re-purposed coffee grinder) will nicely substitute for soaking.

Now, on to the recipe!

Guinness, Horseradish and Sriracha Mustard

Where to buy the ingredients:

Spices can be insanely expensive if you buy them in the wrong place.

This recipe, for example, requires dried allspice berries. Theyâ€™re almost impossible to find in any of the major grocery stores near me, and were extremely expensive in the places that did carry them. However just by chance, I tried Price-Rite and they had a half ounce package for less than $2, which is enough to keep me in mustard for at least a year. They seem to be less expensive and easier to find in grocery stores with a lot of Caribbean customers.

Mustard seeds are another one. Theyâ€™re $8 for a little jar in Price Chopper, but $2 for 14 ounces in the Asian and India markets.

I was unable to find similar savings on the Guinness, however. ðŸ˜Ž
