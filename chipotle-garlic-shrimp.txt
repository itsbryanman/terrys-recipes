Title: Chipotle Garlic Shrimp

This is just like the very best Shrimp Scampi you’ve ever had, only with a touch of heat and smoke from the chipotles.

It’s easy to make even if you don’t cook much, and is guaranteed to impress your “significant other” 😎

Shopping Tip:Unless you can see shrimp boats from your bedroom window, buy the shrimp individually quick-frozen. Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed. There’s no reason to thaw them before you’re ready to cook, since the “spoilage clock” start ticking as soon as they get much above 0°F.

Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you’re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.

Cooking:

Great with some nice crusty bread.

Serves about 3 for dinner

Ingredients:
