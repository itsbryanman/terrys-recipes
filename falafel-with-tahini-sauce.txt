Title: Falafel with Tahini Sauce!

Every few months I’ll have falafel at a restaurant and enjoy it immensely.

Each time I say to myself: “Self? We should make this sometime!”

And then nothing happens.

I even went to the store and bought a bag of dried chickpeas. Three years ago. Been walking by them in the pantry ever since, and just never got around to using them.

A couple of weeks ago there was some sort of fair at NatureTyme and I had falafel at the food truck, really liked it and said “This time I’mreallygoing to do it! And I did.

It wasawesome.

Way better than the food truck or the restaurant.

So here it is. The falafel recipe ingredients list is mostly fromTori Avey. The instructions are mine, based on what I did and what worked and what made things easier/better.
