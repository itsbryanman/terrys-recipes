Title: Potato Leek Soup

This is a beautiful delicate soup with the cream perfectly balanced by the buttermilk.

Ingredients:
- 8 – 10  Leeks (need about 1 Lb after trimming and cleaning)
- 1 Lb Potatoes – peeled and cubed
- 1/2 Lb Potatoes – peeled and cubed (optional)
- 1/2 Stick Unsalted Butter
- 1 Quart Vegetable broth
- 1 C Cream
- 1 C Buttermilk
-   Chives, minced finely
-   Kosher Salt
-   Fresh Ground Pepper (white pepper looks nicer, but regular is fine too)

Directions:
- Trim off and discard the dark green portion of the leeks, as well as the roots.
- Slice the leeks lengthwise and swish around in a bowl of cold water to wash out the sand and dirt (leeks are very sandy), then drain.
- Slice across the leeks to produce small half-moon shapes about 1/2″ wide.
- Add butter to pot and melt
- Add leeks to pot, and a big pinch of salt (maybe 1/2 t)  and sweat on medium until soft.
- Add potatoes and vegetable broth. Raise heat to barely bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer until potatoes are soft (30 – 45 minutes).
- Turn off heat and puree in blender (in batches if necessary) or use an immersion blender if you have one, then return to pot.
- Optional– If you like chunks of potatoes, add the extra 1/2 Lb now, return to heat and simmer until soft.
- Add cream and buttermilk, and salt and pepper to taste.
- Serve in bowls with a sprinkling of chives over the top.
