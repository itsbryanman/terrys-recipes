Title: Chicken Soup

I’ve been working on perfecting my chicken soup recipe for years, and this is the best I’ve had anywhere.

With chicken soup, the most important point to remember is tonever let it come to a boil(it should be just barely simmering). And since most modern chickens don’t taste much like chicken, the other “trick” is to make the brothfirst,thenreduce it until it tastes like chicken, then season it and add the rest of the ingredients.

Serves 6 to 8

Ingredients:
- 1 Whole 4 – 5 Lb Chicken (fowl or roaster)
