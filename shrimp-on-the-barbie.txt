Title: Shrimp on The Barbie

(barbie, not Barbie)

Shrimp cooked over a little plastic doll on fire is terrible.

Shrimp cooked in a metal container full of charcoal is awesome and is so amazingly easy to make that I’m sorry that waited years to try it.

It tastes better than most restaurants. And you can have as many shrimp as you want, not just what shows up when the waiter brings your plate. 😎

Shopping Tip #1:Unless you can see shrimp boats from your bedroom window, buy the shrimp individually quick-frozen. Any non-frozen shrimp you see in the store are just frozen shrimp that the store thawed.

Since “spoilage clock” start ticking as soon as they get much above 0°F, always buy Individually Quick Frozen shrimp that arestill frozen.

Never buy pre-cooked shrimp, since you’re going to cook it. Twice-cooked shrimp are terrible.

Shopping Tip #2:If the bag says “Individually Quick Frozen” but the shrimp are stuck together in a clump, don’t buy it! This means that the bag has been left sitting out somewhere (maybe the Laundry Detergent aisle), then tossed back in the freezer.

The night before, if frozen:
