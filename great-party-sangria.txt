Title: Sangria

Great Party Sangria!

This was a big hit at our last New-Years party!

Note that because of the amount of fruit, this is one place where expensive wine would be a waste.

I used a 5L box of inexpensive “Bisceglia American Burgundy” and it worked great! There’s just no reason to start pouring bottles of $20 wine into the bowl, since by the time you add all the fruit, nobody will know the difference.

Once it’s ready to serve, give it a taste. If it’s too dry or tart, add extra Orange Juice to taste.

Note:If you don’t have a polycarbonate or glass container with a lid, go buy one. Metal and some plastics will give your Sangria an “off” flavor.  It shouldn’t be more than $10 and will last forever, and is certainly worth it considering what you’re spending on your party.

Ingredients:
- 5 Liters Inexpensive (but drinkable), Full-Bodied Dry Red Wine
- 1 Cup Triple-Sec
- 1 Quart Orange Juice (fresh squeezed is great, but the plastic jug of Tropicana “No Pulp” works great also.
- 2  Seedless Oranges, sliced 1/2″ disks, then cut in quarters
- 1  Lime, sliced 1/4″ disks, then cut in half
- 1 1/2 Pounds Red Seedless Grapes, sliced in half
