Title: Pizza Dough

This is a slow rising dough, but is more than worth the time required.

Notes:Chlorine in tap water kills yeast and bottled water contains no chlorine. Because this recipe depends on a small amount of yeast and a slow rise, using chlorinated tap water will result in inconsistent results and great frustration, so use bottled. It doesnâ€™t need to be imported, just non-chlorinated and not highly mineralized.
